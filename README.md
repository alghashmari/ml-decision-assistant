## ü§Ø The Problem

You‚Äôve got a dataset.  
You need to pick an algorithm.  
You end up trying random models and praying something works.  

**Sound familiar?** Been there. That‚Äôs why I built this.

---

## ‚úÖ The Solution

A systematic, diagnostic assistant that recommends the best ML algorithms based on:

- Problem type
- Dataset size + quality
- Interpretability needs
- Bias/variance symptoms

It doesn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúuse XGBoost‚Äù ‚Äî it teaches *why*.  
With math, pros/cons, tips, and debugging guidance.

## ‚ú® What Makes It Different

### üéì Educational-First
Explains reasoning behind each algorithm ‚Äî ideal for students, not just practitioners.

### üßÆ Mathematical Rigor
See the actual cost functions, gradients, and concepts ‚Äî beautifully rendered in LaTeX.

### üîß Practical Guidance
Includes real implementation tips, parameter tuning advice, and usage heuristics.

### ü©∫ Built-In Diagnostics
Diagnose underfitting, overfitting, or data mismatch ‚Äî and fix it systematically.

## üìä Example Workflow

1. Define your problem: Classification? Regression?
2. Describe your data: Small? Sparse? Noisy?
3. Set priorities: Accuracy or interpretability?
4. Get ranked recommendations with explanations
5. Learn the math behind each suggestion
6. Implement with confidence and clarity

## üéì The Philosophy

> ‚ÄúML should be systematic ‚Äî not guesswork.‚Äù

- From theory ‚Üí to decision ‚Üí to implementation
- Designed to **teach, not just tell**
- Debug with logic, not trial-and-error

## üí¨ Feedback

This is my **first major open-source project**. I'd love to know:

- Was it helpful?
- What‚Äôs missing?
- How can I improve it?

Drop an issue, DM me, or fork away.  
**Let‚Äôs make algorithm selection less random ‚Äî and more reliable.**
